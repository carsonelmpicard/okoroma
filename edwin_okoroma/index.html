                </p>

                <p>By playing on UNC’s men’s soccer team that season, the Nigerian-native became the first Black athlete in the history of the university. At a time when Franklin Street was still segregated and less than 100 African Americans attended the university, Okoroma was a pioneer, leading the way for future Black athletes and Black students to attend UNC.
