<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>raveling up to Charlottesville to take on the University of Virginia, Edwin Okoroma and his fellow UNC men’s soccer teammates stopped at a restaurant in a small town between Chapel Hill and Charlottesville. They entered the diner and a lady approached him saying, “We don’t serve Blacks here.”</p>
<p>For Black southerners during the 1960s, this was not an uncommon experience. Okoroma simply responded, “no problem,” and got up to leave the restaurant.</p>
<p>What impressed him the most was the reaction of his teammates. They followed him out as though “[they] had rehearsed it before.”</p>
<p>By playing on the UNC’s men’s soccer team in 1963 and 1964, Okoroma became the first varsity Black athlete in the history of the University. At a time when Franklin Street was still segregated and few African Americans attended the University, Okoroma was a pioneer, leading the way for future Black athletes and students at UNC.</p>
<p>Okoroma was born in Lagos, Nigeria and spent his childhood in his home country. He followed in the footsteps of his older brother, attending a mission school from 1954-1958, which was where he first started playing soccer.</p>
<p>There were three levels of soccer teams at the school. For his two years he only played on the smallest team, known as the mosquito team. He said he was not good enough to qualify for the middle team, which was called the Colt team, or the senior team, which was made up of older boys who represented the school in competitions.</p>
<p>Because of limiting factors like height and weight, Okoroma never was promoted to the upper two teams. While he said he continued to play and practice on his own, he didn’t play organized soccer from 1955 until his first year at UNC on the freshman team in 1962.</p>
<p>“It was nice to keep us busy, and the teacher was very good,” Okoroma said. “And the principal had a lot of encouragement for us young boys because we had just come from elementary school and into these teams and they made it fun for us.”</p>
<p>After secondary school, he went to a post-secondary school in Lagos called the Federal Emergency Science School. He said Nigerians typically had to pay for post-secondary school studies, but his school was an institution set up by the government to train science-oriented students. This meant that his fees were paid for by the government, not his parents.</p>
<p>Okoroma  said he wasn’t able to play soccer at the Federal Emergency Science School  because he didn’t have time for it on top of his studies, opting instead to play the less time-consuming sport of tennis. By focusing on his academics, he was able to earn credit for lower-numbered biology and chemistry classes at UNC, allowing him to graduate from North Carolina in just three years.</p>
<p>Most importantly for Okoroma, though, he was able to find a community through his religion. He is a staunch Anglican, and his father was one of the “founding fathers” of the Anglican Church in his town. His father helped build structures for churches when he was alive, and Okoroma followed in his footsteps by contributing money when he got older to erect a fourth church in the town.</p>
<p>“We also had a very well known Anglican cathedral there, the Christ Church Cathedral in Lagos,” Okoroma said. “That’s where we worshiped.”</p>
<p>Okoroma left this community for an education in the United States by way of the African Scholarship Program of American Universities (ASPAU), an initiative that began under President Kennedy in April 1961.</p>
<p>ASPAU was an expansion of an earlier initiative from the late 1950s, which only awarded scholarships to Africans from Okoroma’s home country of Nigeria. The original program was inspired by Stephen Awokoya, the principal of Okoroma’s post-secondary school. With further expressed interest from other African nations who wanted time to grow their educational standards, ASPAU was born. Because of Nigeria’s past history with United States universities, though, almost a quarter of the ASPAU scholarships were awarded to Nigerian students.</p>
<p>UNC was one of the first southern schools to key in on the scholarship. When ASPAU expanded in 1961, 239 African students were admitted to American universities. In 1962, the year that Okoroma was admitted, that number jumped up to 246. With his enrollment into UNC, Okoroma became the first Black African at the school.</p>
<p>For Okoroma, the financials of his trip were a three-pronged effort — his transportation expenses to the United States were paid for by the Nigerian government, UNC contributed tuition and fees scholarships and the Agency of International Development (AID) provided monthly allowances for essentials like room & board as well as medical insurance.</p>
<p>He was one of 1,534 Africans to win an AID-funded ASPAU Award. When he applied, during the second wave of the award, the process included taking the standard SAT. He was selected based on a mathematical formula that included consideration of school certificate results, higher school certificate results, the SAT, teachers’ and headmasters’ ratings, and interviewer’s ratings.</p>
<p>Being an early winner of the scholarship, a lot of pressure was put on Okoroma’s shoulders to succeed.</p>
<p>“The person who interviewed me in Nigeria here before I left made me to understand that if I succeeded in integrating very well, then the program will continue,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>In fact, when he was interviewing for the scholarship, the panel asked him one simple question: What would he do if somebody stood up from his table while he's trying to eat? He simply responded that he was going to UNC to study, not enforce racial equality.</p>
<p>He would have such an experience, though. After chemistry class one day, he said he walked into Lenoir dining hall past noon when it “was in full swing.” He got his food and looked around for an empty place to sit, a normal occurrence for thousands of Tar Heel students every day. He found an open spot and sat down to eat his food. Sure enough, he watched as a White student immediately got up from the table, left his food sitting there, and walked away.</p>
<p>While he said experiences like these did not bother him, the thing that did irritate him about this moment was what occurred the following spring. After realizing that Okoroma was not an African-American, rather an international student from Nigeria, that same young man who hailed from Mississippi knocked on Okoroma’s door to apologize. Okoroma recognized the man but did not accept the apology.</p>
<p>“That made me more angry,” Okoroma said. “So it was alright for him to sit down with a Black African, but it wasn't good enough to sit down with an American Black student? So I just told him I wasn't impressed with his apology and he should go.”</p>
<p>On the UNC soccer team, though, he said he had “no problem at all” with racial discrimination. After seeing that North Carolina had a soccer team, Okoroma said he tried out with the coach, and earned a spot on the roster. The squad was largely made up of players from the northeast, coming from prep schools in states like New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<h4>[TEAM PICTURE HERE]</h4>
<p>Two of his teammates were Charlie Battle and Jim Talbot. They both echoed that they remembered Okoroma being a good teammate and typically quiet with the team.</p>
<p>“They were right,” Okoroma said. “I was relatively quiet. I was conscious of the fact that I was the only Black player there, and the standards meant that I had to prove myself to belong and qualify for the team.”</p>
<p>For Talbot, when he pictured Okoroma 60 years later, what he remembered most was his broad smile. His relationship with Okoroma was practical because they played the same position. In the fall of 1963, Okoroma’s first year with the team, they both played outside left. </p>
<p>Despite being the leading scorer of that ‘63 team, Talbot was moved to center midfield in 1964, where he said he was “less effective,” to promote Okoroma to a starting position. The decision was a good one: Okoroma finished his final year at UNC as the second-highest scorer on the team with six goals.</p>
<p>“We wanted Edwin in the lineup because he was fast, he had a good left foot, and he played well,” Talbot said.</p>
<h4>[DTH CLIP HERE?]</h4>
<p>During that 1964 season, Talbot and Okoroma combined to thrash N.C. State, 4-1, in their final game against the Wolfpack. Both tallied a brace to lead a dominant victory that saw UNC outshoot N.C. State 32-12. </p>
<p>While Okoroma emerged as a premiere goal-scorer, he said scoring was not his only motivation on the pitch.</p>
<p>“I was more interested in scoring when I had the best opportunity,” Okoroma said. “If somebody was better placed near the goal, then I would pass the ball to him and let him score. But the one important thing was that our team wins.”</p>
<p>Despite Okoroma being the second-leading scorer on the ‘64 team, Battle believes Okoroma does not get the same notoriety for being the first Black athlete like Charlie Scott did in 1966 because of how “low-key” soccer was at the time.</p>
<p>“We used to take bets in the locker room about how many people would be in the stands,” Battle said.</p>
<p>Even Charlie Scott, who became the first Black scholarship athlete at UNC when he played on the basketball team in 1967, said he had not known about Okoroma and his story.</p>
<p>“In the 1960’s, no one ever heard or talked about anything besides football and basketball,” Scott said.</p>
<h4>[CHARLIE SCOTT FILE HERE?]</h4>
<p>In Talbot’s words: “Soccer was a second class citizen back then.”</p>
<p>American sport historian Dr. Matthew Andrews believes that this second class citizenry allowed it to be the first sport to desegregate on UNC’s campus.</p>
<p>“I suspect that it's because soccer was under the radar — no one cared about it,” Andrews said. “When Charles Scott shows up, people care. People celebrate it or people get upset about it — battle lines were drawn. Football, same thing. But soccer, I'm sure no one knew for the most part.”</p>
<p>While Okoroma’s relationship with his teammates was good, Talbot said Okoroma “pretty much went his own way” whenever the team would hang out off the field. </p>
<p>During his first two years at UNC, Okoroma lived with Bill Strong in Teague Dormitory, room number 326. Strong, a fellow medical school student, and Strong’s father, who was a professor of microbiology at the School of Medicine, “were very, very supportive” of Okoroma. He said he was “integrated into their family,” and they even taught Okoroma how to drive.</p>
<p>The only time Okoroma said he felt lonely was during shorter holidays like Thanksgiving. For the most part, he would stay on campus, alone in his dorm. To pass the time, he enjoyed reading or just walking around campus and taking in its beauty.</p>
<p>“UNC’s campus in the springtime was one of the best things you could ever imagine,” Okoroma said. “The cherry blossoms were there and the garden, which was a fun place for students to go and have their night out. It was nice.”</p>
<p>He also took an interest in music, which helped him deal with loneliness. He liked to read and listen to music, falling in love specifically with classical music. He said there were two or three stores on Franklin Street that sold classical music LPs and he visited those shops often.</p>
<p>During his first-year, he used the longer summer break to travel up north to New Jersey where he counseled at Camp Vacamas. He said the young children were very fond of him and they asked him a lot of questions about his background in Africa. This was not uncommon as he said many Americans were ignorant of what life was like in Africa.</p>
<p>“Even my college students in North Carolina didn’t believe that we were not living next to wild animals,” Okoroma said</p>
<p>While working at the camp, he would venture into New York City on weekends with his fellow counselors. One day, he was walking around the city and decided to stay at a hotel in Harlem. Because it was so hot in the summertime, he had to keep the door open as he slept. </p>
<p>When he told his friends about the experience, they said, “You must be mad. Don’t you know anything about Harlem?” They told him he could have been robbed or worse, and he never went back to Harlem again.</p>
<p>When the university was not on holiday and he wasn’t playing on the soccer team, he found community in two other aspects of his life — his studies and his religion.</p>
<p>“My major interest was to study,” Okoroma said. “Because if you lived [in] Africa and you went on scholarship and people told you that the future of the scholarship program depended on your performance, you had to do well to justify continuing the scholarship program.”</p>
<p>Okoroma majored in chemistry, and he said his classmates were quite friendly with him and interacted with him a lot. He recalled that in his second year, there was a fellow student from Africa, a man from Kenya, but he lost touch with him once he left UNC.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, Okoroma joined a few clubs but he said he wasn’t much of a club member at all.</p>
<p>“Maybe I was reacting against being discriminated [against], so I didn't want to make myself popular with the clubs,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>To remind him of home, he joined the YMCA, a group he was a member of back in Nigeria. He said it was a “familiar institution,” and he got along well with the White students in the organization. They would come visit him in Teague dormitory, and he responded by visiting them in their own dorms.</p>
<p>Because there were no Anglican churches at North Carolina, Okoroma attended the Episcopalian Church. He said that because he did well at UNC, he was given the opportunity to stay in the United States for further schooling. The pastor at his church, Reverend Thrash, as well as his deputy helped raise funds for Okoroma to go to medical school before his country could take over the expenses.</p>
<p>When Okoroma graduated in 1965, he applied to UNC medical school but was not admitted.</p>
<p>“The argument they gave was that it was a state school and they were not allowed to take non-Americans,” Okoroma said. “Most of the students had to be from North Carolina.”</p>
<p>Instead, he traveled north to New York to attend the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry.</p>
<p>“The funny thing is that I got admitted to the University of Rochester, which was at least at the time, better recognized as a medical institution than UNC,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>At Rochester, he said there were only about 70 people in his class, and he had more challenges socially in Rochester than Chapel Hill. He graduated in four years, which he said made him the first international Black student to do so at that school.</p>
<p>After finishing medical school, he went back down south to Washington D.C to continue his education at the Children’s Hospital National Medical Centre. While he was there, UNC traveled to Maryland for a soccer game. He attended the match and said head coach Marvin Allen was very happy to see him because he hadn’t seen him since he left UNC. Allen also introduced Okoroma to the squad.</p>
<p>“We chatted like I was still a member of the team,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>While in DC, he was finally able to see his family for the first time in a decade in January of 1973. His dad had died back in 1966, and he wasn’t able to see him before he passed. A year later, he tried to go home but couldn’t because the Nigerian Civil War had broken out. By 1973, he was able to fly back home and spend time with his mother for three weeks.</p>
<p>Two years later, though, Okoroma was able to return to Nigeria for good. He finished his medical education at the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Graduate School in Rochester, Minnesota. He said he was one of the first Black recipients of the American Board of Pediatric cardiology certification after his year at the Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>In 1975, he went back home.</p>
<p>“There was no question about my wanting to go back to Nigeria,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>His program director at the hospital in Washington D.C. tried very hard to persuade him to stay on because Okoroma said there were very few Black pediatricians, and he wanted Okoroma to be there to integrate the faculty.</p>
<p>While he said it’s different now, with students from Nigeria tending to nationalize in America, his home country would always be where his heart was.</p>
<p>“Although I [held] no obligation to return to Nigeria, it was an obligation more for my family to go back and see them,” Okoroma said.</p>
<p>He became a full professor of pediatrics at the University of Nigeria in 1986 and he has worked at the Mefys Hospital in Enugu, Nigeria since 2018. While he has retired from his primary engagement as a consultant in pediatrics, he still continues to work at the hospital.</p>
<p>“That is a million dollar question,” Okoroma said when asked what keeps him going to work every day. “Just the passion of helping children and also making a living for myself.”</p>
<p>Despite the many hardships that he had to face, he came to UNC to get an education and one day return to practice medicine in Nigeria. Both those, he was able to accomplish.</p>
<p>Almost six decades after he graduated from UNC and made history by becoming the first Black varsity athlete at North Carolina, Okoroma still remembers Chapel Hill with “a great deal of fondness.”</p>
<p>“I wish I could visit North Carolina again just to remind me of what life was all like,” Okoroma said.</p>
